        <p>On January 10th, 2025, I participated in my very first hackathon, SB Hacks XI. It was such an cool experience that I wanted to share + offer some tips for first-time hackathon participants.</p>
        
        <p><b>Prior Experience:</b> I entered the hackathon with two Python courses completed and two C++ courses in progress, so I considered myself a beginner. I made the decision to attend without teaming up in advanced, and I was fortunate enough to meet an amazing and talented team. Not only were they experienced, but they were also kind enough to teach me the basics. <br> Even though I had a lot to learn, I was able to keep up, contribute where I could, and gain hands-on experience that made me more confident in my coding skills. We ended up winning the student life track, and I could not have expected anything better.</p>
        <ul><p><b>My tips for first-time hackathoners: </b></p>
            <li>
                <p>Consider going into it solo. Spending twenty-four hours with a fellow beginner friend makes it easy to turn the hackathon into a blast runs the risk of getting distracted and not absorbing the full potential of a hackation. In contrast, spending that time with strangers who are in the same learning phase can foster a sense of shared purpose, engage everyone to push themselves in the hackathon. And going solo gives you the chance to meet someone who knows what they are doing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Try to attend many workshops—they’re an invaluable opportunity to grasp the foundational concepts, explore new interests, even if they seem challenging at first. <br> Even if the material feels difficult to fully understand, it offers you a direction for where to seek further knowledge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don’t hesitate to reach out to mentors for guidance; they are there to support your growth and help you navigate the learning process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Regardless of how your project turns out, <b>don’t skip the presentation</b>. It’s an important opportunity to practice public speaking—a skill that’s essential in life. Presenting may help you realize areas where you need to improve, such as speaking more clearly and conveying your ideas more effectively.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Don’t be afraid to ask questions</b>—whether it’s to your teammates, mentors, or industry professionals. <br> It can feel uncomfortable to ask questions that might expose how little you know, but remember, if you don’t ask, you may never learn. And honestly, if you’re worried about asking questions, it’s likely that you’re not focused on winning prizes anyway. There is nothing to lose but so much to gain. </p>
