        <h2>DataOrbit!</h2>
        <p>March 1, 2025</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="../img/art.jpeg" alt="rubber duckies" title = "duckies" width = "350" height = "440">
            <figcaption>I made in the Painting and Networking event</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Our Team made ChurnOrbit, a project which helps identify customer metrics that indicate a customer may churn (leave the bank), helping banks retain customers.</p>
    
        <p>I was so happy to share that ChurnOrbit made it to the finalists!</p>
    
        <p>I learned so much about how a “datathon” works and what real-world data scientists do.</p>
    
        <p>Let me tell you all about it !(>u<)!</p>
    
        <h2>I teamed up with people I met at the event, and It wasn't until noon on Day 1 that we finalized our project idea.</h2>
    
        <p>Taking the time to pick a project really paid off:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>We bit off exactly how much we could chew - our vision for our project aligned closely with our preexisting skills in the areas of predictive analytics and website making.</li>
            <li>By modeling our project idea around a good dataset, we saved a lot of time.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>We were able to finish the main part of our project very quickly, and spend the majority of day 2 making sure the delivery was perfect–website, interactive models, video.</p>
    
        <h2>Direct things I applied from first hackathon to this one</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Using <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> to deploy the website</li>
            <li>Telling a good story, and explaining why it’s useful</li>
            <li>Task delegation: we did not need all 4 people to work on the data: so we divided it by: 2 people worked on the data and two on the website.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>I learned how to:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Make the website engaging (big texts, symbols.) looking at successful business websites and noticing how simple their UI is.</li>
            <li>I will definitely update my personal website to be more engaging.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Feedback:</h2>
    
        <p>Although it’s difficult to hear critique, I always strive to get feedback from knowledgeable people to build a thicker skin and learn where I can improve.</p>
    
        <p>So I sought feedback from a DS club staff who was very kind to take the time to give some feedback.</p>
    
        <h3>Our Strengths:</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li>We showed judges pretty much everything they wanted to see in a very easy way.</li>
            <li>Our video was fine, we communicated very well (in it).</li>
            <li>It was pretty clear that you guys knew what you were doing.</li>
            <li>Our project was fairly interesting and had more thought than most projects the DS staff mentored (keep in mind that judges only see 8 projects while they see all 52).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Our Weaknesses:</h3>
    
        <ul>
            <li>We show/explain too much. It’s boring to see every graph we made. Next time, we should just focus on the important ones that led to our insights (or the ones that best communicate our message).</li>
            <li>Finance projects kind of automatically get a -2 or -3 in creativity because everyone does finance. It’s hard to do better in that category other than thinking of super clever approaches or super niche problems. This is probably why our creativity score is so low.</li>
            <li>He thought our public speaking was okay but it didn't help that groups before us were better, he recommended practice on that.</li>
            <li>Our presentation was 5 minutes long (the max limit). Try to trim down your presentation a lot, communicate mostly with your words, numbers, and graphs, and less with your text.</li>
            <li>Avoid showing every idea you have and instead show the ones that worked or gave the best insights - for example you guys listed every model you tried.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, pictures and numbers communicate more than words.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Moving forward, some great resources I want to look into:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.statlearning.com" target="_blank">www.statlearning.com</a></li>
            <li>Python edition</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.tmwr.org" target="_blank">www.tmwr.org</a></li>
            <li>I want to sign up for public speaking.</li>
            <li>I want to finish a CSS course and learn JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
