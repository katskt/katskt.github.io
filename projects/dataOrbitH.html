        <h2>DataOrbit!</h2>
        <p>March 1, 2025</p>

        <p>Our Team made ChurnOrbit, a project which helps identify customer metrics that indicate a customer may churn
            (leave the bank), helping banks retain customers.</p>

        <p>I was so happy to share that ChurnOrbit made it to the finalists!</p>

        <p>I learned so much about how a “datathon” works and what real-world data scientists do.</p>

        <p>Let me tell you all about it !(>u<)! </p>

                <h2>I teamed up with people I met at the event, and It wasn't until noon on Day 1 that we finalized our
                    project idea.</h2>

                <p>Taking the time to pick a project really paid off:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We bit off exactly how much we could chew - our vision for our project aligned closely with our
                        preexisting skills in the areas of predictive analytics and website making.</li>
                    <li>By modeling our project idea around a good dataset, we saved a lot of time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We were able to finish the main part of our project very quickly, and spend the majority of day 2
                    making sure the delivery was perfect–website, interactive models, video.</p>

                <h2>Direct things I applied from first hackathon to this one</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel</a> to deploy the website</li>
                    <li>Telling a good story, and explaining why it’s useful</li>
                    <li>Task delegation: we did not need all 4 people to work on the data: so we divided it by: 2 people
                        worked on the data and two on the website.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>I learned how to:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Make the website engaging (big texts, symbols.) looking at successful business websites and
                        noticing how simple their UI is.</li>
                    <li>I will definitely update my personal website to be more engaging.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Feedback:</h2>

                <p>Although it’s difficult to hear critique, I always strive to get feedback from knowledgeable people
                    to build a thicker skin and learn where I can improve.</p>

                <p>So I sought feedback from a DS club staff who was very kind to take the time to give some feedback.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Strengths:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>We showed judges pretty much everything prescreeners wanted to see in a very easy way.</li>
                    <li>Our video was fine, we communicated very well in it.</li>
                    <li>We made it clear we knew what we were doing.</li>
                    <li>Our project was fairly interesting and had more thought than most.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our Weaknesses:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>We explain too much, which may bore the judges. Don't show everything.</li>
                    <li> Focus on the important graphs that led to our insights (or the ones that best communicate our
                        message).</li>
                    <li>Finance projects are automatically considered uncreative because everyone does finance. </li>
                    <li>We can improve on our public speaking; its no use having a great project if the delivery can't
                        show that.</li>
                    <li>Our video was 5 minutes long (the max limit), but it didn't need to be; cut the fluff. </li>
                    <li>Communicate mostly with your words, numbers, and graphs, and less with text.</li>
                    <li>Generally speaking, pictures and numbers communicate more than words.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Some great resources I am bookmarking for myself;</h2>

                <ul>

                    <li>Python edition</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.tmwr.org" target="_blank">www.tmwr.org</a></li>
                    <li>I want to sign up for public speaking.</li>
                    <li>I want to finish a CSS course and learn JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Check Out Our Web App:</h2>

                <p>I'm gonna use a new thing I learned to display the web app on this site.</p>

                <h2>Scores:</h2>

                    <li>Relevance: 28/36</li>
                    <li>Completeness: 33/36</li>
