        <h2>POPTOY</h2>
        <p>April 2, 2025</p>

        <p>Over Spring Break, I had the opportunity to make a website for a toy company, POPTOY.</p>

        <p>Their old website was outdated and many of the links were broken. They hired freelancers to make their
            page, and I felt that many of the descriptions were AI generated and insincere. </p>

        <p>This is where I could help, I offered to overhaul the whole site to simplify it and update with new products,
            and give descriptions that are genuine. I also added my own drawings in ways I saw fit.</p>

        <p>I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Domain transfering--from their old website which was on HostGator to the new one.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Building a working Contact-Us form submissions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implementing animations and transitions to make the site interactive and interesting</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To use @media to design a mobile friendly viewing experience</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Making a mock up in figma before implementing the HTML/CSS</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
