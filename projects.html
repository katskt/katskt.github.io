            <h2>How My First Hackathon Went</h2>
            <p>On January 10th, 2025, I participated in my very first hackathon, SB Hacks XI. It was such an incredible experience that I would like to share my journey and offer some tips for first-time hackathon participants.</p>
            
            <p>Prior Experience: I entered the hackathon with two Python courses completed and two C++ courses in progress, so I considered myself a beginner. I was worried that I wouldn’t be good enough and that the hackathon would pass by without much meaning. I made the decision to attend without teaming up in advanced, and I was fortunate enough to meet an amazing and talented team. Not only were they experienced, but they were also kind enough to teach me the basics. Even though I had a lot to learn, I was able to keep up, contribute where I could, and gain hands-on experience that made me more confident in my coding skills. We ended up winning the student life track, and I could not have expected anything better.</p>
            <ul><p>My tips for first-time hackathoners: </p>
                <li>
                    <p>Sometimes, it’s better to go solo than with friends who are just as inexperienced as you. Think back to when you were younger, and you had so much fun with a friend that your teachers had to separate you. If you spend 24 hours with a close friend, it’s easy to improve your friendship but get distracted and make little progress. On the other hand, spending that time with strangers who are in the same learning phase can foster a sense of shared purpose, helping to drive productivity and keep everyone focused on the task at hand. And going solo gives you the chance to meet someone who knows what they are doing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Try to attend many workshops—they’re an invaluable opportunity to grasp the foundational concepts, explore new interests, even if they seem challenging at first. Even if the material feels difficult to fully understand, it offers you a direction for where to seek further knowledge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don’t hesitate to reach out to mentors for guidance; they are there to support your growth and help you navigate the learning process.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Regardless of how your project turns out, don’t skip the presentation. It’s an important opportunity to practice public speaking—a skill that’s essential in life. Presenting may help you realize areas where you need to improve, such as speaking more clearly and conveying your ideas more effectively. The ability to communicate well is invaluable, both in professional settings and in everyday life.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don’t be afraid to ask questions—whether it’s to your teammates, mentors, or industry professionals. One of the most valuable things I learned at this hackathon was the importance of seeking help. For instance, I learned what "Devpost" was, how to push code to GitHub, and many other fundamentals. It can feel uncomfortable to ask questions that might expose how little you know, but remember, if you don’t ask, you may never learn. And honestly, if you’re worried about asking questions, it’s likely that you’re not focused on winning prizes anyway. So, take the hackathon as an opportunity to learn and grow. Don’t stress about sponsors thinking you’re unprepared—after meeting hundreds of people, they won’t remember you, but they’ll appreciate your curiosity and drive to improve.</p>

            <p>Overall, I couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out.
